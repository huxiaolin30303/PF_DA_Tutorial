Number of PF steps and step interval are defined in the PF_configData.java

Generate observation data and true state data
   -- Run the TrueSystemSimulation.java by instantiating the trafficControlSys_Real model. 
   -- Case I and Case II random seeds are defined in model_configData.java
   -- the data are saved by the transducer_real_dataSaving.java
          
Run particle filter to estimate state
  -- run the PF.java 
  -- If using different number of measurement data, change the computeWeight(). 
  -- the DA results are saved by the DAResult0.txt file
  -- If running DA for multiple time (i.e., the batch run case), modify the main() of the PF.java
  
Note: the discrete event simulation model is a DEVSJAVA simulation model. You will need the DEVSJAVA simulation environment if you want to run the simulations.
